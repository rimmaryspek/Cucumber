Class 1 -

BDD - behavioral driven development -
	Given
	When
	And
	Then
We use BDD scenarios - to give a clear understanding to other colleagues in the team


To write the BDD scenarios in cucumber - we use special type of file

User story 12345 - Search an employee

Search by id
Given user navigates to HRMS application
When user enters valid username and password
And user clicks on login button
Then user navigates to dashboard page
When user clicks on PIM option
And user clicks on employee information button
When user enters employee id
And user clicks on search button
Then user see employee information is displayed

Search by name
Given user navigates to HRMS application
When user enters valid username and password
And user clicks on login button
Then user navigates to dashboard page
When user clicks on PIM option
And user clicks on employee information button
When user enters valid employee name
And user clicks on search button
Then user see employee information is displayed

Class 2 -

Recap -
      BDD - It allows us to write scenarios in gherkin language

      Feature - User story
      Scenario - Test case - every test case will be considered as scenario in BDD
      Given - pre-requisite/pre-condition
      When - perform actions
      Then - Expected output
      And - Supporting tag

      Step definition - Cucumber provides you the snippet of step definition
      In step definition, we write the code to perform actions which has been written in
      the BDD statement

      To execute all the feature files from one class, we need runner class

To keep everything organised we need framework -
Framework allows you to write simplified and organised code and
it provides folder to structure which is easily understandable

Framework we have 2 separate branches for
Java -  In java, we write all java classes
Non - Java - In non-java, we write non java part such as features, files etc
steps package - for all step definitions
runners package - for all runner classes
config directory - for all config files
features directory - for all feature files

Class 3 -
    Recap - BDD - Behavioral driven development
    because the explanation part was available in diagram

Class 4 -
    Recap -
    Runner class - Cucumber options in runner class
    features - to run the feature file, we provide a path to its repository
    glue - the path of our step definitions package
    dryRun - if we set it to true, it stops actual execution and scans all the steps quickly
    and provide us missing step definition
    monochrome - to remove irrelavant information from the console
    plugin - pretty - to print the steps in the console
    tags - to group the scenario for specific type of execution


POM - page object model - it is a design pattern

it allows QA's to keep object repository -
in simple language, QA's write all the locators of the page in respective class

LoginPage -
DashboardPage -

Class 5 -
        Recap - runner class - to run our test cases as per the requirement
                                to generate missing steps
                                to print the steps into the console
                                to generate the report

        Page object model - to have organised code and easy to maintain structure
        according to it, we create separate class (page) according to the
        screens available in the application and keep all the locators of this page
        in it

Hooks - we write pre condition and post condition using hooks in cucumber
    @Before - pre condition needs to be mentioned in this
    @After - post condition needs to be mentioned in this

Rules - Hooks class must be created inside steps package

Background - it is applicable only for one feature file
             it means for every feature file background will be different
             steps which are common among all the scenarios of that featur file
             will be taken into background but make sure the flow is not broken.
             if the flow breaks, then we cannot take steps in background after that


Hooks VS background

Hooks are applicable for whole project (for all the feature files)
Background is applicable for one feature file and varies from file to file
First Hooks execute then background execute then scenario execute

Class 6 -
    Recap -
        Page object model with page initializer class
        in this initializer class, we initialize all the objects of page classes and
        call the method in common methods class in openbrowser method

    We created a collection point in steps classes -
    -- methods call from common method, locators call from respective page classes using
       object of that class

    Background - same steps in feature file among all the scenarios should be a part of it
    Hooks - Pre condition and Post condition for the entire project
    here we use 2 hooks - @Before and @After

    Parameterization testing
    -- we can one add employee using feature file - 'instead of passing hardcoded data,
    we pass values inside the scenario such as "abc" , "xyz" etc'

    -- to increase the scope of testing, we use data driven testing concept
    instead of scenario, we use scenario outline with examples table
    -- in examples table, we pass multiple data sets using keys and values


Data table -
     it allows us to pass multiple sets of data without executing background

Outline - Examples table - hooks and background execute every time as per the data set
Scenario - Data table - hooks and background execute just one time
